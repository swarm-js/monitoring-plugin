## About The Project

The Monitoring plugin will watch every request done on your API, log them in memory, and provide an endpoint to retrieve analytics.

## Built With

- TypeScript@4

## Getting Started

### Installation

```sh
yarn add @swarmjs/monitoring
```

or

```sh
npm install --save @swarmjs/monitoring
```

## Usage

```ts
import { Swarm } from '@swarmjs/core'
import { MonitoringPlugin } from '@swarmjs/monitoring'

// Create instance
const app = new Swarm()

// Use the plugin
app.use(MonitoringPlugin, {
  controllerName: 'MonitoringPlugin', // Customize controller name into your API
  prefix: '/__monitoring__', // Customize route to access to analytics
  access: null // Restricts access to logged users, based on SwarmJS ACL
})
```
